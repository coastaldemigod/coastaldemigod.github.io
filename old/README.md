2. Tiles grow/shrink animation
3. Visually appealing 
4. Color changing icons
5. Responsive Design 
6. Material and quirky aesthetic
```
* ### Tech Stack :-

```
1. HTML
2. CSS/Bootstrap
3. Javascript & Jquery
```

* ### Problems Faced <br>

> Initially I was stuck with a horizontal scrollbar . Then I couldn't get my margins right and they kept on overlapping on each other , here Bootstrap came to rescue . There were a lot many problems but the online community always came to my rescue . 
<br>

* ### Scope of improvement<br>

> While designing the website I haven't kept the performance in mind . Thus I need to work on the performance aspect of the website . I am also planning to include a notes and a blog section to the website .
<br>

> Well the journey wasn't very smooth for me but I surely learnt a great deal of stuff on my way to building this small website.
<br>

## Adios.
